    "## Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by clearly defining the problem you want to solve with reinforcement learning. Understand the nature of the problem and the environment in which it occurs. Consider questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the agent trying to achieve?\n",
    "* What are the relevant states, actions, and rewards in the problem?\n",
    "* Is the problem episodic (has distinct episodes) or continuous?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of the MDP: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. __State Space(S)__: \n",
    "    * Define the set of possible states that fully describe the environment. States should be Markovian, meaning the future state depends only on the current state and action.\n",
    "    * Consider what information is relevant for making decisions and modeling the problem.\n",
    "2. __Action Space (A)__:\n",
    "    * Specify the set of actions that the agent can take in each state. Actions represent the choices available to the agent.\n",
    "    * Determine whether the action space is discrete or continuous.\n",
    "3. __Transition Dynamics (P)__:\n",
    "    * Describe how the system transitions from one state to another based on the agent's actions.\n",
    "    * Specify the transition probabilities or dynamics (e.g., deterministic or stochastic transitions).\n",
    "4. __Reward Function (R)__: \n",
    "    * Define the immediate reward function that provides feedback to the agent after each action.\n",
    "    * Determine what constitutes a positive or negative reward, and what you want to optimize (e.g., maximizing cumulative rewards or reaching a specific goal).\n",
    "5. __Discount Factor (γ)__:\n",
    "    * Choose a discount factor between 0 and 1 to balance the agent's preference for immediate rewards versus long-term rewards.\n",
    "    * Consider the time horizon and importance of future rewards.\n",
    "6. __Terminal States (Optional)__:\n",
    "    * Identify any terminal states where episodes end. This is especially relevant for episodic problems.\n",
    "    * Specify the conditions that lead to episode termination (e.g., reaching a goal or exceeding a time limit).\n",
    "7. __Policy (π)__:\n",
    "    * Decide whether you want to start with a specific policy or leave it to be learned.\n",
    "    * If using a learned policy, choose a policy representation (e.g., deterministic, stochastic, neural network-based).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Considerations:\n",
    "* __Value Function (Optional)__:\n",
    "    * Determine whether you want to compute value functions (state values or action values) to estimate the expected cumulative rewards.\n",
    "* __Exploration vs. Exploitation__:\n",
    "    * Consider how the agent explores the environment to learn optimal policies. Define exploration strategies if needed (e.g., ε-greedy exploration).\n",
    "* __Learning Algorithm__:\n",
    "    * Decide which reinforcement learning algorithm is suitable for your problem (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, DDPG, PPO) based on the characteristics of your MDP.\n",
    "* __Environment Interaction__:\n",
    "    * Specify how the agent interacts with the environment to collect data for learning (e.g., through episodes or continuous interaction).\n",
    "* __Simulations and Environments__:\n",
    "    * If applicable, determine how to simulate or implement the environment for experimentation and training.\n",
    "* __Hyperparameters__:\n",
    "    * Identify hyperparameters such as learning rates, discount factors, exploration parameters, and neural network architectures.\n",
    "* __Validation and Testing__:\n",
    "    * Before applying reinforcement learning algorithms, validate your MDP design by considering scenarios, edge cases, and the problem's real-world constraints. Test your MDP with simple algorithms and verify that it behaves as expected.\n"

    "## Problem Description:\n",
    "The problem is to design an MDP for a robot vacuum cleaner that operates in a small room. The robot's goal is to clean the entire room efficiently. It needs to navigate the room, deciding where to move next, and receive rewards based on its cleaning performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of the MDP:\n",
    "1. __State Space (S)__:\n",
    "    * The state space consists of the positions of the robot in the room and the cleanliness status of each grid cell.\n",
    "    * A state (s) can be represented as a tuple: (robot_position, room_cleanliness), where robot_position is the (x, y) coordinates of the robot, and room_cleanliness is a binary array representing whether each grid cell is clean or dirty.\n",
    "2. __Action Space (A)__:\n",
    "    * The action space includes actions the robot can take, such as moving in four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) or staying in the same place.\n",
    "    * Actions can be represented as: {up, down, left, right, stay}.\n",
    "3. __Transition Dynamics (P)__:\n",
    "    * Define the transition probabilities based on the robot's actions. For example:\n",
    "    * Moving actions result in the robot transitioning to the corresponding neighboring grid cell with a high probability, given the room's layout.\n",
    "    * Staying in the same place may result in a small probability of the robot moving due to sensor noise.\n",
    "4. __Reward Function (R)__:\n",
    "    * The immediate reward function provides feedback to the robot after each action:\n",
    "    * +1 for cleaning a dirty grid cell.\n",
    "    * -1 for attempting to move outside the room or staying in a clean grid cell.\n",
    "    * 0 for all other actions.\n",
    "5. __Discount Factor (γ)__:\n",
    "     * Choose a discount factor, say γ = 0.9, to balance short-term and long-term rewards.\n",
    "6. __Terminal States (Optional)__:\n",
    "    * Define a terminal state condition: the robot may consider the episode complete when it has cleaned all dirty grid cells.\n",
    "7. __Policy (π)__:\n",
    "    * Decide whether to use a predefined policy (e.g., random exploration) or to learn an optimal policy using RL algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Value Function (Optional)__:\n",
    "    * You may compute the state values to estimate the expected cumulative reward from each state under a given policy.\n",
    "* __Exploration vs. Exploitation__:\n",
    "     * Consider exploration strategies to ensure the robot explores the room efficiently while cleaning.\n",
    "* __Learning Algorithm__:\n",
    "     * Choose a suitable RL algorithm for learning an optimal cleaning policy (e.g., Q-learning, Monte Carlo methods).\n",
    "* __Environment Interaction__:\n",
    "    * Implement the room environment, including the robot's movement and the state transitions.\n",
    "* __Hyperparameters__:\n",
    "    * Set learning rates, exploration rates, and other hyperparameters specific to the RL algorithm you choose."
