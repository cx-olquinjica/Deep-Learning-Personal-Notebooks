    "__Image Augmentation__ generates similar but distinct training examples after a series of random changes to the training images, thereby expanding the size of the training set. Other motivations for image augmentation include: \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Random tweaks of training examples allow models to rely less on certain attributes, thereby improving their generalization ability. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   * We can crop an image in different ways to make the object of interest appear in different positions, thereby reducing the dependece of a model on the position of the object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * We can also adjust factors such as brightness and color to reduce a model's sensivity to color. "
