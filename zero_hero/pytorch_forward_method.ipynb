    "Here's how the forward method is executed in PyTorch:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Create an Instance__: First, an instance of the model class, such as _model = TransformerEncoderBlock(...)_, is created. This initializes the model's parameters and constructs the model architecture.\n",
    "2. __Input Data__: The input data is prepared in the appropriate format expected by the model. This usually involves converting the input data into PyTorch tensors. \n",
    "3. __Call the Model__: To execute the model and perform the forward pass, _the instance of the model is called as function, passing the input data as arguments._ For example, _output = model(input-data)_. \n",
    "4. __Execution of forward__: When the model is called, it internally invokes the _forward method_. The input data is passed as an argument to the forward method. \n",
    "5. __Computation flow__: Inside the _forward method_, the input data flows through the defined computations and layers of the model. The specific computations depend on the architecture and implementation of the model.\n",
    "6. __Output__: The _forward method_ returns the output of the computation. This can be the final predictions, itermediate representations, or any other relevant information derived from the input data.\n",
    "7. __End of Execution__: Once the forward method completes, the output is returned to the cadller of the model, and ther forward pass is finished. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the _forward method_ is executed implicitly when the model instance is called as function. This allows the input data to flow through the model's computations, producing the desired input."
